## Japanese Primer 
## meta - AI Powered Assistant Guideline




NOTE: Model selected llama3-70B-instruct <br>

Due to regional limitations on accessing llama from <strong>Meta AI platform </strong> to further our primer use-case for learning LLM/GenAI 

- Because of this technical restriction, we made efforts and opted to look for another platform without restrictions on location access and had the same intended model llama3-70b-instruct we aim to leverage in our tasks 



## Restrictions

--> Dev's choice 
- Meta AI platform ** Not accessible from region 
--> Next action
- Switched to NVIDIA Platform

## Considerations 
- Meta AI access is region restricted and as such unfortunately our Propmt work was halted here on that regard 

- It was found on working with Meta AI, Access to the Meta AI portal is limited to but a few regions accross the globe 
- This prompted us to look for alternatives while sticking to the intended target model <llama 3-70b-instruct Model>
- An alternative UI with the deployed model was used to perform the required imput tasks regarding access. Visit [NVIDIA](https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama3-70b) for a detailed look
