- BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
- BAD: the beginner sentenceis unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
- BAD: In the clues, we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
- BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual

Let's break down the sentence "Hyenas are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?" into its components and create a vocabulary table to help you transcribe it into Japanese.

**Vocabulary Table**

|               | doa       | Door                                                             |

|               | okoru     | to occur, to happen                                              |

|               | no        | (possessive particle, but you need to figure out how to use it!) |

**Sentence Structure Clue**
The sentence can be broken down into two parts: a statement and a question. The statement describes the situation, and the question asks about the cause of the situation.

**Possible Sentence Structure**
[Statement] [Particle] [Question]

    <score_reasons>

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
