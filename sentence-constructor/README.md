## Japanese Primer 

- a quick primer on the different features of the japanese language 

Why does japanese make a good use-case for learning LLM/GenAI ?

## Japanese writing systems
- Hiragana : native words
- Katakana : represents foreign loanwords, technical terms, onomatopoeia and for emphasis
- Kanji: Borrowed Chinese characters. <elementary school-> learn 5000 words for 6 years> >>>> 3000 kanji used in common conversation 
- Romaji : Representation of Japanese sounds using the latin alphament :::nihon
- Emoji: Graphical text representation of emojis >>>  :::jp >>>>> <mostly for youngsters not for formalities>

### Hiragana alphabet
- Same word in different writing systems >>>>>>>>>>  Check assets - There are  variants with markers  
- There are diagraphs by smaller kana >>>>>>>>>>>>>> Means there is a combo of two that gets you one 
- Little words that represents a break in sound 

### Katanana alphabet
same style table,  

\\ Furigana is when hiragana japanese appears beside kanji to decipher its reading  \\ 


### Kanji alphabet  
- Has multiple reading types 
- You cannot expect the same kanji to always make the same sound 
- you simply need to understand and remember its multiple readdings.
>>>>>>>>> Kanji broken to two types of reading , Onyomi - Sound Reading : Based on Chinese Pronouncinations.
>>>>>>>>> Kunyomi - Based on the native japanese word that matches the meaning of the kanji.
- kanji itself by adding nothing is the kunyomi meaning and adding workds and more at the end and beginning with furigana we will observe this to be done.

## Technical uncertainty 
- How well can ai  powered as perform a very broad task 
- Would a very broad task be better performed by diving into subtaks with specialist agents 
- Does using AI powered assistant make fir a good place to rapidly prototypoe agent 
- How could we take the agent we built in an AI powered assistant and reimplement it into a stak that allows direct integrations 
- How much to refactor on the occurence of rollover to another 
- What prompting techniques scan we naturally discover working in the confides of AI powered assistant 
Are there any Interesting inovatuons unique to specific AI powered assistants for our business goal 
- What were we able to achieve based on our AI powered assistant choice nad our hardware or budget limitations
