## Functional Requirements

- A company looks into the prospect of investing in their own infastructure 
- Reason is because there is a concern on privacy of their user data and another concern that the cost of managed services for GenAI will greatly rise in cost.

- They want to invest an AI PC where they can afford spend of $10000 -$15000
- They have 300 active students, and students are located within the city of Nagasaki. 

## Assumptions 
 - We are assuming that the chosen open source LLMs we will decide on will have sufficient power to run on hardware with an investment of 10 - 15k 

 - we will have our single server in office hooked to the internet and have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students.

 ## Data Strategy 

- There is a concern of copyrighted materials so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in the database 

## Considerations 

Were considering using IBM granite because its truly an open source model with training data that is traceable so we can avoid any copyright issues and we are able to know what is on in the model.
